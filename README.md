# Tendril — Compassionate Care

**A compassionate hygiene tracker and anonymous support space that gently helps you care for yourself, one soft task at a time.**

---

## Problem

For people struggling with mental health issues or chronic pain, maintaining hygiene tasks like brushing teeth, showering, and doing the dishes regularly can become overwhelming and impossible. Most habit-tracking apps use rigid methods that trigger stress and shame in users. There is a growing need for systems that help people develop hygiene habits through compassion and kindness.

## How Tendril Helps

- Sends gentle task reminders
- Tracks a **“tender streak”** — a streak that *pauses* instead of breaking
- Offers an **anonymous forum** where users can share feelings and tips
- Rewrites posts/comments gently using AI, flagging harsh self-talk (e.g. "lazy" → "struggling")
- Delivers a **daily affirmation** through a calming loading screen

---

## Features

- Pastel-themed hygiene checklist
- Streak tracker that **pauses**, not punishes
- Daily “Tip of the Day” affirmation via AI
- Anonymous post and comment board
- AI moderation: softens harmful self-talk using compassionate rewrites
