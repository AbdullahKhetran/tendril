Remember, you're strong and capable, and you can get through this. Let's take a deep breath together and break it down into smaller steps. You got this!\"\n\nIn this rewritten version, I've aimed to convey compassion and understanding by acknowledging the person's feelings and offering reassurance. By using words like \"tough experience\" and \"overwhelmed\", I'm acknowledging the emotional impact of the situation, rather than dismissing it with a harsh judgment. I've also added phrases like \"it's okay\" and \"you're strong and capable\" to offer a sense of encouragement and support.",
